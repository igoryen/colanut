				"Tom McCormick is the Founder and CEO of The Nationwide Group of Companies (TNG): <a href=\"#\">www.tngoc.com</a>.",
				" During his tenure as the principal of Canada's largest appraisal company, Tom noticed the centralization of lenders. In order to facilitate appraisal requests nationally; Tom created the concept of an Appraisal Management Company in Canada (AMC).",
				"Since that inception, NAS has continued to be the market leader in innovation, product offerings and process improvements for the mortgage industry. This is evident in NAS's market share of over 60%, number of valuations annually of 450,000 and a mortgage value of over 6 billion dollars.",
				"Tom took NAS to the Caribbean islands, where NAS introduced on-line forms software, mobile app's and a comparable sales data base, all the firsts for the Caribbean.",
				"Tom, looking for further international opportunities has launched NAS in Mexico, where his technology has also provided new and innovative products to help the Mexican market build compliance and regulations around the mortgage industry.",
				"When Tom looked at opportunities in the US, it was evident that the complexity of the market would not allow NAS to be grown organically as in all other countries. Tom found a unique company to acquire called \"InHouseUSA\" located in California, that offered two products, a traditional AMC and a technology platform that allowed lenders to manage their own panel of appraisers, essentially taking the regulatory risks \".",
				"<strong><i>Today, NAS provides more valuations in more countries than any other valuation platform in the world</i></strong>",
				"Another opportunity Tom saw was in the recovery business within Canada and Nationwide Recovery Services (NRS) was formed. NRS is a robust workflow management system that enables communication between lenders and their legal, real estate, property management, and appraisal professionals, and ensures the most effective use of resources to complete the recovery cycle. NRS brings oversight, insight and intelligence to the process of recovering debts.",
				"Tom also launched Nationwide Home Closing Services (HCS), which is Canada's first online real estate and mortgage closing platform that utilizes transformative technologies to empower the consumer by bringing together professionals into one centralized network to manage the legal and closing process for Purchase, Sale, Refinance, Transfer, and Line of Credit transactions."
